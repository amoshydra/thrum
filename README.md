**Sinkrill** streams your Linux PC's audio output to Sonos speakers over your LAN —
an AirPlay-like "PC audio" sink in a single static binary.

> **sinkrill** *(noun)*: *rill* is a small stream. A sinkrill is the stream that
> runs from your audio sink to the room.

It defaults to uncompressed **WAV PCM**, because Sonos gives a WAV file stream
far less buffering than an internet-radio style MP3 stream: **~0.1 s** buffered
instead of **~4.8 s** (measured; see [Latency](#latency)).

```bash
sinkrill --virtual-sink                 # recommended: add a "Sinkrill" output device
sinkrill "Living Room" --virtual-sink   # pick a room
sinkrill --no-tune                      # only serve the stream; tune Sonos yourself
```

Without `--virtual-sink`, Sinkrill mirrors your current output instead: the PC and
Sonos both play, and no new device appears.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop playback and shut down.

## Why

- **Looks like a speaker.** `--virtual-sink` creates a real PipeWire/PulseAudio
  output device called **Sinkrill**, so you pick it in your audio settings or
  per-app.
- **Low latency by default.** WAV over plain HTTP avoids Sonos's internet-radio
  pre-buffer: ~0.1 s buffered, measured, instead of ~4.8 s with MP3.
- **No Node, no npm, no Icecast.** One static binary; it shells out to
  `parec`/`pactl` (already part of your audio stack) and optionally `ffmpeg`.
- **No cloud, no account.** Audio never leaves your LAN.

## Two ways to use it

### Output device (recommended)

`--virtual-sink` creates a PipeWire/PulseAudio output named **Sinkrill**:

```bash
sinkrill --virtual-sink
```

Pick **Sinkrill** in your audio settings (or per-app in `pavucontrol`), and only
the audio routed to it goes to Sonos. The device disappears when Sinkrill exits.

### Mirror the current output

Without the flag, Sinkrill captures whatever is playing on your default output:

```bash
sinkrill
```

The PC and Sonos both play, and no new device appears. Use this when you just
want the room to hear what the PC is playing.

## How it works

```
                     PipeWire/PulseAudio

                      SetAVTransportURI
```

1. `parec` records the monitor of your current audio output
   (`@DEFAULT_MONITOR@`), or of the virtual **Sinkrill** device created by
   `--virtual-sink`. If `parec` is missing, `ffmpeg -f pulse` is used instead.
2. The bytes are served as a continuous 48 kHz/16-bit stereo WAV stream.
3. Sonos is told to play `http://<lan-ip>:<port>/stream.wav`. Because that looks
   like a file rather than internet radio, Sonos skips its multi-second
   pre-buffer.
4. `--format mp3` encodes with ffmpeg and uses `x-rincon-mp3radio://` instead
   (radio handling, ~192 kbps, much more buffering).

There is **no warm-up buffer** by default, so a newly connected speaker starts
at the current live position. Add `--warmup 500` if you have flaky Wi-Fi and
would rather trade latency for robustness.

## Requirements

- **Linux** with PipeWire or PulseAudio
- `parec` and `pactl` (in `libpulse` on Arch, `pulseaudio-utils` on Debian)
- `ffmpeg` only if you use `--format mp3`
- Go 1.22+ only if you build from source

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S libpulse          # ffmpeg is optional (MP3 mode)

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils
```

### Platform support

Sinkrill is **Linux-only** today. Sonos discovery, control, and HTTP streaming
are already portable — audio capture is the part that is not.

| Platform | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Linux (PipeWire/PulseAudio) | **Supported** — `parec`, with `ffmpeg -f pulse` as a fallback |
| Windows | Builds, but no capture backend yet. Needs WASAPI loopback. |
| macOS | Builds, but no capture backend yet. Needs CoreAudio taps or a virtual device such as BlackHole. |
| Android / Termux | Not viable. Android does not expose the system audio mix to apps; only `MediaProjection`, from inside a real APK, can capture playback. |

On an unsupported platform the binary exits with a clear message rather than
falling over later. A port needs one new file in
[`internal/capture`](internal/capture) with a build tag and an entry in
`platformBackends`; the capture hot path stays untouched.

## Install

### Binary (recommended)

Download the latest release, verify the checksum, and put it on your `PATH`:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/amoshydra/sinkrill/releases/latest/download/sinkrill-linux-amd64
curl -LO https://github.com/amoshydra/sinkrill/releases/latest/download/sinkrill-linux-amd64.sha256
sha256sum -c sinkrill-linux-amd64.sha256

install -Dm755 sinkrill-linux-amd64 ~/.local/bin/sinkrill
sinkrill --help
```

Use `sinkrill-linux-arm64` on ARM machines.

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/amoshydra/sinkrill@latest
```

Make sure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is on your `PATH`.

### Arch (AUR)

A `PKGBUILD` is in [`contrib/aur`](contrib/aur). Once the package is in the AUR:

```bash
yay -S sinkrill
```

Until then, build it straight from the repo — it pins the released `v0.2.0`
tarball:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amoshydra/sinkrill.git
cd sinkrill/contrib/aur
makepkg -si
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amoshydra/sinkrill.git
cd sinkrill
make            # builds ./sinkrill
make install    # installs to /usr/local/bin (PREFIX=/... to override)
```

## Usage

```bash
# Recommended: add the "Sinkrill" output device
sinkrill --virtual-sink

# Choose a room by name, or a speaker by IP
sinkrill "Living Room" --virtual-sink
sinkrill --device 192.168.1.42 --virtual-sink

# Mirror the current output instead (no new device)
sinkrill
sinkrill "Living Room"

# List what's on the network
sinkrill devices

# Stop playback without starting a stream
sinkrill stop "Living Room"

# Volume, without touching the stream or restarting anything
sinkrill volume                 # print it
sinkrill volume 40              # set it
sinkrill volume +5              # nudge up (also: up 10)
sinkrill volume -5              # nudge down (also: down)
sinkrill volume mute            # unmute to undo

# Point the speaker back at the running stream (manual keepalive)
sinkrill retune

# What the running instance is doing
sinkrill status

# Live panel: volume, mute, play/pause, retune
sinkrill tui

# Panel and stream in one command
sinkrill tui "Living Room" --virtual-sink

# Serve only: prints the URL to paste into the Sonos app
sinkrill --no-tune

# Diagnose silence, capture, and routing
sinkrill doctor

# Capture a specific source instead of the default output
sinkrill --source alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB_Audio-00.analog-stereo.monitor
```

Starting a second copy while a stream is live exits immediately and names the
running instance, rather than printing a bare `bind: address already in use`.
Use `sinkrill status` to inspect it, or `--port 0` to run another stream on a
free port.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-d, --device <name\|ip>` | auto | Sonos room name (partial match) or IP address |
| `-s, --source <source>` | `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@` | PulseAudio/PipeWire source to record |
| `-p, --port <port>` | `8567` | HTTP port (`0` picks a free one) |
| `-f, --format <wav\|mp3>` | `wav` | `wav` = lowest latency (~1.5 Mbps); `mp3` = ~192 kbps, more buffering |
| `-b, --bitrate <kbps>` | `192` | MP3 bitrate, only used with `--format mp3` |
| `--warmup <ms>` | `0` | Replay this much recent audio to a new listener (higher latency) |
| `--host <ip>` | auto | LAN IP advertised to Sonos |
| `--bind <address>` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP bind address |
| `--ffmpeg <path>` | `ffmpeg` | ffmpeg binary |
| `--parec <path>` | `parec` | parec binary |
| `--volume <0-100>` | unchanged | Set the speaker volume on start |
| `--keepalive` | off | Re-tune if the speaker stops by itself |
| `--no-tune` | off | Don't control Sonos; only serve the stream |
| `--virtual-sink [name]` | off | Create the **Sinkrill** output device (recommended); default name `sinkrill` |
| `--station <name>` | `<hostname> streaming audio` | Name shown on the speaker |
| `-v, --verbose` | off | Verbose logs |

### HTTP endpoints

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/stream.wav` | Live WAV PCM stream (default) |
| `/stream.mp3` | Live MP3 stream (`--format mp3`) |
| `/stream` | Alias for whichever format is active |
| `/status` | JSON: device, source, format, listeners, queue, capture state |
| `/health` | `{"ok":true}` |
Point VLC, a browser, or anything else at `http://<lan-ip>:8567/stream.wav`
(or `/stream.mp3` with MP3 mode) to preview locally.

## Latency

The defaults are tuned for the lowest latency this approach allows:

- **WAV PCM over plain HTTP** — Sonos treats it as a file, so it skips the
  internet-radio pre-buffer (the biggest single win)
- no warm-up replay (`--warmup 0`)
- ~20 ms capture latency (`parec --latency-msec=20`)
- no resampling or encoder delay in WAV mode
- a byte-bounded listener queue (~125 ms) that drops old audio instead of
  drifting behind, plus `TCP_NODELAY` and a small send buffer

Measured with the built-in probe: **~0.10 s** of buffered audio on the Sonos
side for WAV, versus **~4.8 s** for MP3 radio streaming. Add the capture side
(~20–30 ms) and you are at roughly **0.1 s end-to-end**.

That is good enough for casual video and most desktop audio. It is not a
wired-grade path; if you need the absolute minimum:

| Path | Latency | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| HDMI to a Sonos soundbar | ~30 ms | Arc/Beam/Ray/Playbar/Playbase |
| Line-in on Port/Amp/Five/Play:5/Era + adapter | 75 ms min | set *Audio Delay → Low*; grouped rooms add delay |
| Bluetooth (Roam/Move/Era 100/300) | ~150–300 ms | not under 100 ms |
| AirPlay 2 | ~2 s | worse than WAV mode |

`--format mp3` is the fallback for weak Wi-Fi or very old speakers: ~192 kbps
instead of ~1.5 Mbps, at the cost of Sonos's radio buffer.

WAV is a RIFF container with 32-bit size fields, so the header can only
advertise a 4 GB stream — about **6 h 12 min** at 192 kB/s. When the speaker
reaches that length it treats the track as finished and stops; the stream is
still running. `--keepalive` re-tunes within ~20 s, or run `sinkrill retune`
to restart the clock. MP3 mode uses a radio scheme with no length at all, so
it has no such horizon.

## Output device mode (recommended)

`--virtual-sink` creates a real output device called **Sinkrill** in
PipeWire/PulseAudio:

```bash
sinkrill --virtual-sink
```

Now choose **Sinkrill** as the output in your desktop audio settings (or per-app in
`pavucontrol` → Playback, or with `wpctl set-default <id>`). Only audio routed
to that device goes to the speaker; everything else keeps playing locally. The
device is removed again when Sinkrill exits.

```bash
sinkrill --virtual-sink sinkrill          # explicit name
sinkrill --virtual-sink my-tv-sink     # any valid sink name
```

If you'd rather own the device yourself (so it survives restarts), create it
once and capture its monitor:

```bash
pactl load-module module-null-sink \
  sink_name=sinkrill \
  sink_properties=device.description=Sinkrill

sinkrill --source sinkrill.monitor
```

## Control

Sinkrill runs in the foreground. `Ctrl+C` stops the speaker, kills the capture
process, removes the virtual device, and exits.

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Start / stop | `sinkrill --virtual-sink` / `Ctrl+C` (or `sinkrill stop "Living Room"`) |
| Volume | `sinkrill volume 40` while running, `sinkrill volume +5` / `mute`, or `--volume 40` on start |
| Panel | `sinkrill tui` — live volume, mute, play/pause, stop, and re-tune; or `sinkrill tui "Living Room" --virtual-sink` to start the stream there too |
| Re-tune | `sinkrill retune` — points the room back at the running stream, e.g. after another device took it |
| Leftovers | `sinkrill cleanup` — removes the output device and stray capture process after a `kill -9` or crash |
| Pause / resume | The panel, or the Sonos app; long pauses may drop the stream connection, then restart `sinkrill` (or run with `--keepalive`) |
| Change room | stop, then `sinkrill "Other Room" --virtual-sink` |
| Inspect | `sinkrill status` (or `curl http://<lan-ip>:8567/status`) |
| Preview | open `http://<lan-ip>:8567/stream.wav` in VLC or a browser |

### Control panel

`sinkrill tui` opens a small live panel in a second terminal while the stream
runs. It follows the local instance, so it shows capture health and buffering
next to the room's state:

```text
 sinkrill  homedesktop streaming audio
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Room      Den
  State     playing
  Playing   this stream
  Volume    [====================    ]  82
  Stream    wav, 1536 kbps
  Capture   running, last data 19 ms ago, 0 restarts
  Buffer    0 B queued, 0 dropped, 1 listener
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  up/down 2   left/right 10   m mute   space play/pause   s stop
  r retune    n/b track       q quit
  ready
```

`up`/`down` nudge the volume by 2, `left`/`right` by 10 (`+`, `-`, `[`, `]`
do the same). `n`/`b` skip within the room's queue, which only does something
when the room is playing an album or playlist rather than this stream. `r`
points the room back at this stream, the same as `sinkrill retune`. `q`, `Esc`,
and `Ctrl+C` all leave the panel; the stream keeps running.

Bare `sinkrill tui` attaches to the instance that is already running — started
in another terminal, by a service, or by an older binary. Add a room or any
stream option and the panel starts the stream itself, exactly as `sinkrill`
would:

```bash
sinkrill tui "Living Room" --virtual-sink
```

That is one command for audio plus controls. Quitting it (`q`) stops the
stream: the speaker, the capture process, and the virtual device are all
released before the terminal is handed back. While it runs, the stream's own
log lines appear in the panel instead of printing over it.

To drive a room that the running instance is not tuned to — say your stream is
on Den and you want Kitchen to join it — add `--attach`, which starts nothing:

```bash
sinkrill tui --attach --device "Kitchen"
```

`r` then re-points Kitchen at the running stream. The panel never changes the
stream's formatting, capture, or port.


## Run as a user service

The unit runs `/usr/bin/sinkrill`, which is where the Arch package puts it. If
you installed the binary somewhere else, point `ExecStart` at it.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp contrib/systemd/sinkrill.service ~/.config/systemd/user/

# only if you did not install to /usr/bin:
sed -i "s|/usr/bin/sinkrill|$HOME/.local/bin/sinkrill|" \
  ~/.config/systemd/user/sinkrill.service

# set the room name
$EDITOR ~/.config/systemd/user/sinkrill.service

systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now sinkrill
journalctl --user -u sinkrill -f
```

## If you hear nothing

Run:

```bash
sinkrill doctor
```

It checks the server, the capture, the output device, and the speaker, and
prints the next command to run.

If the capture is **stalled** (it can happen after a PipeWire/PulseAudio
hiccup), restart Sinkrill. The 5-second watchdog normally recovers this
automatically, but a restart always recreates the sink and capture:

```bash
systemctl --user restart sinkrill
# or, if running in a terminal: Ctrl+C, then start it again
```

The watchdog only fires when the capture delivers **zero bytes**. Silence is
still PCM data — an idle PC produces silent frames continuously — so "nothing
is playing" does not trigger it.

Then check the three volume/routing stages:

```bash
pactl info | grep 'Default Sink'      # should be: sinkrill
pactl get-sink-mute sinkrill             # should be: no
pactl set-sink-volume sinkrill 100%      # keep Sinkrill at 100%, control level on Sonos
```

And check the speaker: the Sonos app should show **playing**, not muted, with a
reasonable volume.

Test the whole path with a generated tone (this works on Arch too; the
`/usr/share/sounds/alsa/...` path is Debian/Ubuntu-only):

```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=2" -ar 48000 -ac 2 /tmp/sinkrill-tone.wav
paplay --device=sinkrill /tmp/sinkrill-tone.wav
```

If `paplay` says `open(): No such file or directory`, the *file* is missing —
that is not a Sinkrill or device error. If the tone is silent on the speaker, run
`sinkrill doctor` again.

## Troubleshooting

**The "Sinkrill" output device is still in my audio settings**

That happens when sinkrill was killed with `SIGKILL` or crashed, so its cleanup
never ran: the null sink and the capture process attached to it both survive.
A later run finds the sink already there and leaves it alone, because it did
not create it.

```bash
sinkrill cleanup
```

That stops any stray capture process for the device and unloads the sink. It
refuses while a running instance is actually using that device. `Ctrl+C` and
`SIGTERM` both clean up properly, so this is only needed after a hard kill.

**No Sonos devices found**

- Make sure the speakers are powered on and on the same network.
- SSDP multicast is often blocked by VPNs, guest Wi-Fi/AP isolation, or some
  switches. Sinkrill falls back to scanning the local `/24` on port `1400`, but a
  VPN that captures LAN traffic can still hide the speakers. Try
  `sinkrill devices --timeout 8000`, or pass `--device <ip>` directly.
- If the scan also fails, find the speaker's IP in your router, then use
  `--device <ip>`.

**Sonos says it can't connect / nothing plays**

- The speaker must be able to reach `<your-lan-ip>:<port>` directly. Check your
  firewall (e.g. `ufw allow 8567/tcp`) and that `--host` is the LAN interface's
  address, not a VPN or Docker address.
- Make sure the port isn't already in use; use `--port 0` to pick a free one.
- Try `sinkrill --no-tune` and open
  `http://<lan-ip>:<port>/stream.wav` from another device to verify reachability.

**No sound, but the stream is running**

- `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@` records the current output. If audio is routed to a
  different device, pass `--source <that-device>.monitor`.
- List sources with `pactl list short sources`.
- DRM-protected playback (Netflix, some streaming apps) may produce silence in
  the capture. That's a platform restriction, not a bug.

**It feels laggy**

- Check `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8567/status | grep -E 'queuedBytes|droppedChunks'`.
  `queuedBytes` should stay near 0; a large queue means a listener is behind.
- Make sure you are in WAV mode (`format: "wav"`), not MP3.
- Sonos's own buffer is ~0.1 s; a wired line-in or HDMI is the only way lower.

**The speaker stops after a while**

- Live streams stop themselves when the connection hiccups. Restart with
  `--keepalive` to let Sinkrill re-tune automatically. Note that this can also
  undo a manual stop from the Sonos app.

**The log says `capture delivered no bytes ... restarting`**

- That is the watchdog recovering a stalled `parec`. It should recover in a few
  seconds. If it repeats, check `pactl list short sources` and run `sinkrill doctor`.
- This is not triggered by silence: an idle sink still delivers silent PCM
  frames. It only fires when the capture process produces zero bytes.

**Capture restarts in the logs**

- `parec`/`ffmpeg` is restarted automatically if it exits, and the speaker is
  retuned. Check the warnings for the reason (usually an invalid `--source`).

## Development

```bash
make test        # go test ./...
make vet         # go vet ./...
make build       # ./sinkrill
make fmt
```

Measure how much audio Sonos buffers (stop the running service first; the probe
retunes the speaker):

```bash
./sinkrill probe wav 30
./sinkrill probe mp3 30
```
